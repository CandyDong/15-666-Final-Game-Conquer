## Design: <br/>

This is a multiplayer player game played on a grid. Players can move in 4 directions. While moving, each player leaves a “trail”, which he can use to make an enclose an area to create territories. In order to win, a player needs to own more than half of the area on the entire board. Every 5-10 seconds, the board grows by a few tiles in all directions so as to avoid dominant strategies where players win by controlling the borders.

## How To Play: <br />

W,S,A,D or Up, Down, Left, Right keys to move the player. <br />

A player can take another player’s territory by encircling the area owned by another player. The game gets more interesting when players interact close to each other. They need to carefully fight against each other over small patches of territory since running into either another player’s trail or territory will cause them to lose their own trails.
